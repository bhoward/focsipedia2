    "# Introduction to Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "(Content adapted from Critchlow & Eck)\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are fundamental in computer programming,\n",
    "although not everything in programming that goes by the name of \"function\"\n",
    "is a function according to the mathematical definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer programming, a function is a routine that is given \n",
    "some data as input and that will calculate and return an\n",
    "answer based on that data.  For example, in the Java programming\n",
    "language, a function that calculates the cube of an integer\n",
    "could be written\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int cube(int n) {\n",
    "    return n * n * n;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Java, _int_ is a data type.  From the mathematical\n",
    "point of view, a data type is a set.  The data type _int_\n",
    "is the set of all integers that can be represented as 32-bit \n",
    "binary numbers.  Mathematically, then, $\\textit{int}\\subseteq\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "(You should get used to the fact that sets and functions can\n",
    "have names that consist of more than one character, since\n",
    "it's done all the time in computer programming.)\n",
    "The first line of the above function definition,\n",
    "\"`int cube(int n)`\", says that we are defining\n",
    "a function named _cube_ whose range is _int_\n",
    "and whose domain is _int_.  In the usual notation for\n",
    "functions, we would express this as $\\textit{cube}\\colon \\textit{int}\\to\\textit{int}$,\n",
    "or possibly as $\\textit{cube}\\in{\\textit{int}}^{\\textit{int}}$,\n",
    "where ${\\textit{int}}^{\\textit{int}}$ is the set of all\n",
    "functions that map the set _int_ to the set _int_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of the function, `int cube(int n)`, is called\n",
    "the **signature** of the function (in some languages, such as C++, it\n",
    "is called the **prototype**).  The signature specifies the\n",
    "name, the domain, and the range of the function and so carries\n",
    "exactly the same information as the notation \"$f\\colon A\\to B$\".\n",
    "The \"$n$\" in \"`int cube(int n)`\" is a name for\n",
    "an arbitrary element of the data type _int_.  In computer\n",
    "jargon, $n$ is called a **parameter** of the function.\n",
    "The rest of the definition of _cube_ tells the computer\n",
    "to calculate the value of $\\textit{cube}(n)$ for any $n\\in\\textit{int}$\n",
    "by multiplying $n\\times n\\times n$.  The statement \"`return n * n * n`\"\n",
    "says that $n\\times n\\times n$ is the value that is computed, or \"returned,\"\n",
    "by the function.  (The $*$ stands for multiplication.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Java has many data types in addition to _int_.  There is\n",
    "a boolean data type named _boolean_.  The values of type\n",
    "_boolean_ are _true_ and _false_.  Mathematically,\n",
    "_boolean_ is a name for the set $\\{\\textit{true},\\,\\textit{false}\\}$.\n",
    "The type _double_ consists of real numbers, which can\n",
    "include a decimal point.  Of course, on a computer, it's not\n",
    "possible to represent the entire infinite set of real numbers,\n",
    "so _double_ represents some subset of the mathematical set\n",
    "of real numbers.  There is also a data type whose values are\n",
    "strings of characters, such as \"Hello world\" or \"xyz152QQZ\".\n",
    "The name for this data type in Java is _String_.  All these\n",
    "types, and many others, can be used in functions.  For example,\n",
    "in Java, $m\\,\\%\\,n$ is the remainder when the integer $m$ is\n",
    "divided by the integer $n$.  We can define a function to test\n",
    "whether an integer is even as follows:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "boolean even(int k) {\n",
    "    if ( k % 2 == 1 )\n",
    "      return false;\n",
    "    else\n",
    "      return true;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You don't need to worry about all the details here, but you should\n",
    "understand that the signature, `boolean even(int k)`,\n",
    "says that _even_ is a function from the set _int_\n",
    "to the set _boolean_.  That is,\n",
    "$\\textit{even}\\colon\\textit{int}\\to\\textit{boolean}$.  Given\n",
    "an integer $N$, $\\textit{even}(N)$ has the value _true_\n",
    "if $N$ is an even integer, and it has the value _false_\n",
    "if $N$ is an odd integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can have more than one parameter.  For example, we might\n",
    "define a function with signature `int index(String str, String sub)`.\n",
    "If $s$ and $t$ are strings, then $\\textit{index}(s,t)$ would be the\n",
    "_int_ that is the value of the function at the ordered pair\n",
    "$(s,t)$.  We see that the domain of _index_ is the cross product\n",
    "$\\textit{String}\\times\\textit{String}$, and we can write\n",
    "$\\textit{index}\\colon \\textit{String}\\times\\textit{String}\\to\\textit{int}$\n",
    "or, equivalently, $\\textit{index}\\in\\textit{int}^{\\textit{String}\\times\\textit{String}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partial and Impure Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every Java function is actually a function in the mathematical\n",
    "sense.  In mathematics, a function must associate a single value in\n",
    "its range to each value in its domain.  There are two things\n",
    "that can go wrong:  The value of the function might not be defined\n",
    "for every element of the domain, and the function might associate\n",
    "several different values to the same element of the domain.\n",
    "Both of these things can happen with Java functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer programming, it is very common for a \"function\" to be\n",
    "undefined for some values of its parameter.  In mathematics,\n",
    "a **partial function** from a set $A$ to\n",
    "a set $B$ is defined to be a function from a subset of $A$ to $B$.\n",
    "A partial function from $A$ to $B$ can be undefined for some\n",
    "elements of $A$, but when it is defined for some $a\\in A$,\n",
    "it associates just one element of $B$ to $a$.  Many functions\n",
    "in computer programs are actually partial functions.  (When \n",
    "dealing with partial functions, an ordinary function, which is\n",
    "defined for every element of its domain, is sometimes referred to\n",
    "as a **total function**.  Note that&mdash;with the mind-boggling\n",
    "logic that is typical of mathematicians&mdash;a total function is\n",
    "a type of partial function, because a set is a subset of itself.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also very common for a \"function\" in a computer program\n",
    "to produce a variety of values for the same value of its parameter.\n",
    "This most frequently occurs because the function is **impure**&mdash;either\n",
    "it has a **side-effect** (such as changing the value of a global\n",
    "variable) beyond just computing a result, or it relies on a value that\n",
    "has been changed as a side-effect of some other part of the program.\n",
    "Another way to say that a function is impure is that it depends on a\n",
    "**hidden state**&mdash;some extra information affecting the result that\n",
    "is not provided by the function's direct inputs.\n",
    "A common example is the method in the _java.util.Random_ class with signature\n",
    "`int nextInt(int N)`, which returns a random integer between\n",
    "0 and $N-1$.  The value of _nextInt_(5) could be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n",
    "This is not the behavior of a mathematical function! Behind the scenes,\n",
    "this function is storing a variable called the \"seed\", which is used to\n",
    "generate a random value, plus a new value for the seed, each time the\n",
    "function is called. Each time the seed changes, the next value to be\n",
    "returned is likely to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though many functions in computer programs are not really\n",
    "mathematical functions, I will continue to refer to them as\n",
    "functions in this section.  Mathematicians will just have to stretch\n",
    "their definitions a bit to accommodate the realities of computer\n",
    "programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pure Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Java, a typical functional programming language such as Scala,\n",
    "Haskell, or ReasonML will actively discourage the use of side-effects\n",
    "in functions.[^io] The benefit of restricting the programmer to\n",
    "**pure** functions, that always return the same value for a given\n",
    "argument, is that it becomes possible to reason about the behavior\n",
    "**algebraically**, freely substituting the returned values in place\n",
    "of function calls without having to worry about whether some \"hidden state\"\n",
    "might have changed since the last time the function was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that we have a function that computes the value of\n",
    "some polynomial, such as $f(x)=x^2+2x+1$. If we know that another function\n",
    "$g\\colon\\textit{String}\\to\\textit{int}$ is pure, then we can be sure\n",
    "that $f(g(s))$ is the same as $g(s)^2+2\\cdot g(s)+1$, as well as\n",
    "$(g(s)+1)^2$. All of these are algebraically equivalent, as long as $g$\n",
    "is pure. This allows the programmer to reason more easily about the\n",
    "correctness of their program, and it also enables the computer to choose\n",
    "any equivalent expression for evaluation, ideally choosing the most\n",
    "efficient version.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common ways that a functional language will encourage\n",
    "pure functions is to do away with, or at least severely restrict, the\n",
    "ability to update the value assigned to a variable. In pure Scala, there\n",
    "is no assignment statement. When a value is bound to a variable with a\n",
    "`val` statement, that variable will then remain bound to that value for\n",
    "as long as the variable exists. A variable will cease to exist when the\n",
    "block (such as a function body) containing it is finished:"

    "\n",
    "## First-Class Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In most programming languages, functions are not first-class\n",
    "objects.  That is, a function cannot\n",
    "be treated as a data value in the same way as a _String_\n",
    "or an _int_.  However, recent versions of Java have taken a step in this\n",
    "direction.  It is possible for a function to be a parameter\n",
    "to another function, as long as it is wrapped in a \"function object\".\n",
    "For example, consider the function signature\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int sumten( Function<Integer, Integer> f )\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is a signature for a function named _sumten_ whose\n",
    "parameter is a function object.  The parameter is specified by the\n",
    "type \"`Function<Integer, Integer>`\".  If _S_ and _T_ are types, then\n",
    "the type `Function<S, T>` represents functions from _S_ to _T_. Therefore,\n",
    "the parameter of _sumten_ is essentially a function from _int_ to _int_.[^int]\n",
    "The parameter name, $f$, stands for an arbitrary such function.  Mathematically,\n",
    "$f\\in \\textit{int}^{\\textit{int}}$, and so\n",
    "$\\textit{sumten}\\colon \\textit{int}^{\\textit{int}}\\to\\textit{int}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "My idea is that $\\textit{sumten}(f)$ would compute\n",
    "$f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$.  A more useful function would\n",
    "be able to compute $f(a)+f(a+1)+\\cdots+f(b)$ for any integers\n",
    "$a$ and $b$.  This just means that $a$ and $b$ should be\n",
    "parameters to the function.  The signature for the improved\n",
    "function would look like\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int sum( Function<Integer, Integer> f, int a, int b )\n",
    "```\n",
    "The parameters to _sum_ form an ordered triple in which\n",
    "the first coordinate is a function and the second and third\n",
    "coordinates are integers.  So, we could write\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textit{sum}\\colon \\textit{int}^{\\textit{int}}\n",
    "       \\times\\textit{int}\\times\\textit{int}\\to\\textit{int}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "It's interesting that computer programmers deal routinely\n",
    "with such complex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways of providing a function object as an\n",
    "argument in Java. If we want to pass the method _m_ of an object\n",
    "_x_, where the signature of _m_ is `int m( int i )`, then\n",
    "we can call our function as `sum(x::m, a, b)`. However, a more\n",
    "general technique is to use an **anonymous function**, also known\n",
    "as a **lambda**.[^lambda]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anonymous functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, an expression such as `i -> { return i * i * i; }`\n",
    "creates a function object that takes an _int_ (this will be\n",
    "determined from the context) and returns another _int_. This\n",
    "particular function cubes its input. Thus, if we call our _sum_ function as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "sum(i -> { return i * i * i; }, 3, 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "the result will be $3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3$,\n",
    "which is 216.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many languages now support a similar syntax for creating anonymous\n",
    "function values, and offer some facility for working with functions\n",
    "as (mostly) first-class objects. For example, the same function\n",
    "is expressed in Scala as `(i: Int) => { i * i * i }`. Since one of the hallmarks of\n",
    "the functional languages is their ability to work with function\n",
    "values, you can imagine that they tend to provide the most\n",
    "thorough integration of functions with other kinds of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are complete demos of the _sum_ example, first in Java and\n",
    "then in Scala:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.function.Function;\n",
    "\n",
    "public class SumDemo {\n",
    "  private static int sum(Function<Integer, Integer> f, int a, int b) {\n",

    "```reason edit\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each of the following Java function signatures, translate the\n",
    "signature into a standard mathematical function specification, such\n",
    "as $\\textit{func}\\colon\\textit{double}\\to\\textit{int}$.\n",
    "   * `int strlen(String s)`\n",
    "   * `double pythag(double x, double y)`\n",
    "   * `int round(double x)`\n",
    "   * `String sub(String s, int n, int m)`\n",
    "   * `String unlikely(Function<String, Integer> f)`\n",
    "   * `int h(Function<Integer, Integer> f, Function<Integer, Integer> g)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a Java function signature for a function that\n",
    "belongs to each of the following sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * $\\textit{String}^{\\textit{String}}$\n",
    "   * $\\textit{boolean}^{\\textit{double}\\times\\textit{double}}$\n",
    "   * $\\textit{double}^{ \\textit{int}^{\\textit{int}} }$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is possible to define new types in Java.  For example, the\n",
    "definition\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Point {\n",
    "  public double x;\n",
    "  public double y;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "defines a new type named _Point_.  A value of type _Point_\n",
    "contains two values of type _double_.  What mathematical operation\n",
    "corresponds to the construction of this data type?  Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Let _cube_, _sum_ and _monomial_\n",
    "be the ReasonML functions described in this section.  What is the\n",
    "value of each of the following?\n",
    "   * _sum_(_cube_, 2, 4)\n",
    "   * _sum_(_monomial_(5, 2), 1, 3)\n",
    "   * _monomial_(_cube_(2), 7)\n",
    "   * _sum_($n\\Rightarrow\\{ 2*n \\}$, 1, 5)\n",
    "   * _cube_(_sum_(_monomial_(2, 3), 1, 2))\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a ReasonML function named _compose_\n",
    "that computes the composition of two functions.  That\n",
    "is, $\\textit{compose}(f, g)$ is $f\\circ g$, where\n",
    "$f$ and $g$ are functions of one parameter.  Recall that\n",
    "$f\\circ g$ is the function defined by $(f\\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Consider the following ReasonML function:\n",
    "```reason edit\n",
    "let exercise = (a, b) => {\n",
    "  let m = (x, y) => { x - y };\n",
    "  let s = n => { n * n };\n",
    "  let c = m(a, b);\n",
    "  let d = m(a, c);\n",
    "  let e = c + d;\n",
    "  s(d) - s(e)\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "   * What is the value of `exercise(4, 5)`?\n",
    "   * What is the value of `exercise(12, 13)`?\n",
    "   * Use algebraic substitution to evaluate `exercise(a, b)` in terms of the\n",
    "     variables `a` and `b`.\n",

    "[^io]: The most common exception is for functions that send\n",
    "output to the console, such as the `print_int` function in ReasonML.\n",
    "Being able to track execution and easily display results is very\n",
    "useful, and printing a line on the console is a fairly benign\n",
    "side-effect&mdash;it won't cause the function to return different\n",
    "values for the same arguments. However, printing a result can still\n",
    "interfere with algebraic reasoning about a program, because interchanging\n",
    "such a function call with its value can affect whether and how many times\n",

    "[^lambda]: The mathematician Alonzo Church introduced in\n",

    "of writing \"the function $f$ where $f(x) = \\textit{some formula}$\",\n",
    "he wrote \"$\\lambda x(\\textit{some formula})$\". When the first\n",
