* Write these sections:
   + Shortest Paths; Minimum Spanning Trees (need edge labels on graphs)
   + Transitive Closure
   + Divide-and-Conquer
   + Greedy Algorithms
   + Dynamic Programming
   + String Search
   + Hashtables and Bloom Filters
   + Bucket, Counting, and Radix Sort
   + Backtracking and A* Search
   + Tractability
   + NP Completeness
   + Amortized Analysis
   + Knuth-Morris-Pratt

* Revise these sections:
   + Balanced Binary Search Trees
   + Add complete binary tree heaps?
   + Recursive Descent Parsing

* Potential new topics:
   + Hasse diagrams
   + BDDs
   + Tries
   + Cayley graphs (as examples of DFA)?
   + Markov chains
   + PageRank
   + Ropes
   + Zippers (simple case: gap buffer)
   + Finger trees?
   + Union-Find
